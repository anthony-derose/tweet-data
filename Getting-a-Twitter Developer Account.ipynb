You'll have to fill out a form describing what you want to do with the developer account. Explain that you are doing this for a class at Rutgers University and that you don't know exactly what you're building yet and just need the account to get started. These applications are approved by some sort of AI system, so it doesn't matter exactly what you write. Just don't enter a bunch of alweiofalwiuhflawiuehflawuihflaiwhfe type stuff or you might get rejected.\n",
    "4. Once you're logged into your developer account, [create an application for this assignment](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).  You can call it whatever you want, and you can write any URL when it asks for a web site.  You don't need to provide a callback URL.\n",
    "5. On the page for that application, find your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.\n",
    "6. On the same page, create an Access Token.  Record the resulting Access Token and Access Token Secret.\n",
